## NOTES ##
- x86_64, instruction: syscall, syscall # and retval in $rax
- Calling conventions:

        User-level applications use as integer registers for passing
        the sequence %rdi, %rsi, %rdx, %rcx, %r8 and %r9. The kernel
        interface uses %rdi, %rsi, %rdx, %r10, %r8 and %r9.

        A system-call is done via the syscall instruction. The
        kernel destroys registers %rcx and %r11.

        The number of the syscall has to be passed in register
        %rax.

        System-calls are limited to six arguments, no argument
        is passed directly on the stack.

        Returning from the syscall, register %rax contains the
        result of the system-call. A value in the range between -4095
        and -1 indicates an error, it is -errno.

        Only values of class INTEGER or class MEMORY are
        passed to the kernel.



        Once arguments are classified, the registers get assigned (in
        left-to-right order) for passing as follows:

        If the class is MEMORY, pass the argument on the stack.
        If the class is INTEGER, the next available register
        of the sequence %rdi, %rsi, %rdx, %rcx, %r8 and %r9 is
        used

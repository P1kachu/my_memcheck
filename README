Level1 - Strace:
       src/level1
       Use of ptrace to track system calls from a traced program
       Prints arguments for execve, fork, vfork, clone, exit,
       exit_group, brk, mmap, munmap, mremap, mprotect
       Catches return code with edi (exit*)
       prints PID and where the error was raised
       Prints other functions names, but no arguments

Level2 - Hooked Strace:
       src/level2
       #include Level1
       - PTRACE_SYSCALL
       + HOOK ON SYSCALLS
       1 line against 700 less effective but hey, WE rule the stuff now

Level3 - Memory tracer:
       src/level3
       #include Level{1,2}
       Hooks on frequently used function that play with memory
       malloc, realloc, free, calloc
       Save each allocated area, to check if we are not out of bound
       Pretty neat

Level4 - Memory checker:
       src/level4
       #include Level{1...3}
